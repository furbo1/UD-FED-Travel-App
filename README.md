# Project Description

This Travel App project uses three different third party APIs:
1. First we used http://www.geonames.org/ for coordinates of desired place to travel 
2. Second, we used https://darksky.net for weather information
3. Lastly, we used https://pixabay.com/ to get a picture from the desired place to travel


# How it works:
The user enters the destination, departure date and returning date. Then the Travel App displays the following:
 - A picture from the destination
 - Departure date
 - Return date
 - Duration of the trip
 - The number of days the trip until the trip starts
  - High/Low temperatures and weather summary of the destination

## Getting started
1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` into your project folder and run:
- `npm install`
3. Run `npm run start` 

### Additional functionalities added to enhance the project
- Added end date and displayed length of the trip
- Allowed user to remove the trip
- It allows user to add mulitiple trips
